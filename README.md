When we have a time series data with short span of time, auto.arima in R tends to declair every time series as a white noise which is an ARIMA model of no parameters. What if there's a better candidate model  within auto.arima which may have a better cross validation RMSE or even a better exponential model for that declaired white noise series? This code helps us find that candidate model from auto.arima. The figure also provides the flow chart of the simple algorithm.
